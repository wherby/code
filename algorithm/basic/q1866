# Using n number to construt a permutation
n!
123,132,213,231,312,321

# Using n number to construct a circular permutation
n! / n = (n-1)!
123 (231,312) 132 (321,213)

=> or considered as fixing the head, running permutation for the rest.


# choose m from n number to construct a permutation
A(n,m) = n!/(n-m)!

# choose m from n number to construct a circular permutation
A2(n,m) = n!/(n-m)! /m

# Using n numbers to construct m circular permutation

dp[i][j] : the number of ways that we can use first i numbers to construct j circular permutations

1. if i-th element is for a new circular permutation.
   dp[i-1][j-1]
2. insert the i-th element to the pervious j circular permutaions
   dp[i-1][j] * (i-1)

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] *(i-1)

Sterling 1
S[i][j] = S[i-1][j-1] + S[i-1][j] * (i-1)


[a1 x ...x][a2 x...x][a3 x...x][ak x....x]  <= 用n个数字构造k个环排列,环排列的第一个元素是环的最大，并且a1 < a2 < a3 .. < ak


# 
dp[i][j] the number of ways that we use the first i sticks to construct a permutation with j visible sticks

1. if i-th element is for a new visible stick
 dp[i-1][j-1]
2. if i-th element is the part of previous j intervals
 dp[i-1][j] *(i-1)
