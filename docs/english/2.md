what makes a home? Love and sympathy and confidence. It is a place where kindly affections exist among all members of family. The parents take care of their children, and the children are interested in the activities of their parents. Thus all of them are bound together by affection, and they find their home to be the cheeriest place of world.
A home without love is no more a home than a body without a soul is a man. Every civilized person is a social being.  No one should live alone. A man may lead a successful and prosperous live, but prosperity alone can by no means insure happiness. Many great personages in the world history had deep affections for their home.
Your home may be poor and humble, but your duty lies there. You should try to make it cheerful and comfortable. The greater the difficulties, the richer will by your reward.
A home is more than a family dwelling. It is a school in which person are trained for citizenship. A man will not render good services to his country if he can do nothing good for his home; for in proportion as he loves his home, will he love his country. The home is the birthplace of true patriotism. It is the secret of social welfare and national greatness. It is the basis and origin of civilization.
